# GitHub Actions Fixes Summary

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Deprecated Actions/Upload-Artifact@v3**
- **Problem**: `actions/upload-artifact@v3` is deprecated as of April 16, 2024
- **Solution**: Updated all instances to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/ci-dev.yml`

### 2. **Self-Hosted Runner Dependencies**

- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ No need to maintain self-hosted runner infrastructure
  - ✅ Consistent, clean environment for each run
  - ✅ Better security isolation
  - ✅ Automatic updates and maintenance by GitHub

### 3. **Updated Actions/Cache to v4**

- **Files Updated**: All workflow files

## 📋 Changes Made

### **CI/CD Pipeline (ci-cd.yml)**
```yaml
# BEFORE
runs-on: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 'self-hosted' || 'ubuntu-latest' }}
runs-on: self-hosted
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
uses: actions/cache@v3

# AFTER  
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
uses: actions/cache@v4
```

### **Pull Request CI (ci-pr.yml)**
```yaml
# BEFORE
runs-on: self-hosted
matrix:
  os: [self-hosted, ubuntu-latest]
uses: actions/cache@v3

# AFTER
runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
matrix:
  os: [ubuntu-latest]
uses: actions/cache@v4
```

### **Development CI (ci-dev.yml)**
```yaml
# BEFORE
matrix:
  runner: [self-hosted, ubuntu-latest]
runs-on: self-hosted
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
uses: actions/cache@v3

# AFTER
matrix:
  runner: [ubuntu-latest]
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
uses: actions/cache@v4
```

## ✅ Benefits of Changes

### **Reliability**
- ✅ **No self-hosted runner maintenance** - No need to manage runner infrastructure
- ✅ **Consistent environments** - Fresh, clean runner for each job
- ✅ **Better error handling** - GitHub-hosted runners are more reliable

### **Security**
- ✅ **Isolated execution** - Each job runs in a fresh environment
- ✅ **No local dependencies** - No risk of local environment conflicts
- ✅ **Automatic security updates** - GitHub maintains the runner images

### **Performance**
- ✅ **Latest action versions** - Using v4 actions with performance improvements
- ✅ **Faster startup** - No need to queue for self-hosted runners
- ✅ **Better caching** - Improved cache performance with v4

### **Maintenance**
- ✅ **Zero infrastructure overhead** - No need to manage Windows runner
- ✅ **Automatic updates** - GitHub handles runner OS and tool updates
- ✅ **Cost effective** - No need to maintain dedicated runner machine

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Verify Workflows** - All workflows should now run successfully on GitHub runners
2. **Monitor Performance** - GitHub runners should provide consistent performance
3. **Remove Self-Hosted Runner** - You can stop and remove the self-hosted runner from your machine
4. **Update Documentation** - Remove any references to self-hosted runner setup

## 📝 Removing Self-Hosted Runner

If you want to completely remove the self-hosted runner:

```powershell
# Stop the runner service
cd C:\github-runner
.\svc.sh stop

# Uninstall the service  
.\svc.sh uninstall

# Remove runner configuration
.\config.cmd remove --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

# Delete the runner directory
cd ..
Remove-Item "C:\github-runner" -Recurse -Force
```

The CI/CD pipeline is now fully cloud-native and should work reliably! 🎉
